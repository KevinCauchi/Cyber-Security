# Cyber-Security

Cyber Security Shift Cipher. This code prints a Translation Table, Encrypts, Decrypts, and gives a Frequency Analysis on your plaintext code and also 
on the code on your Corpus file. Please note that the Corpus file can be loaded with random words and phrases. But the overall goal is to help play an 
attacker's role to guess your plain text message. For my corpus.txt file, I used the book The Great Gatsby by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.
